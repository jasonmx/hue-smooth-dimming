This integration extends the core Philips Hue integration and lets you:
* Use third-party buttons to dim your Hue lights smoothly.
* Set brightness, color and color temp while lights are off.

## How It Helps You 🔅💡🔆

* **Silky Smooth:** Dimming is continuous and precise. No more jittery repeat loops and dimming overshoots.
* **Predictable:** Prepare your lights to turn on how you want them. No more color flashes or brightness extremes as lights turn on.
* **Zero Setup:** Finds your lights automatically via the core Philips Hue integration.

## Get Started

### Requirements
* Philips Hue Bridge V2 or Pro (V3)
* **[Philips Hue integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hue)** set up and connected to that bridge
* Not supported: Hue bulbs paired directly to Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA or deCONZ without a bridge

### Install from HACS
1. Open the Philips Hue Smooth Dimmer HACS repository

[![Open the Philips Hue Smooth Dimmer HACS repository in your Home Assistant instance.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jasonmx&repository=philips-hue-smooth-dimmer&category=integration)

2. Click **Download**
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration

## Usage

### Smooth Dimming

Use these 3 actions in the HA Automations editor:

| Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hue_dimmer.raise` | Start raising brightness |
| `hue_dimmer.lower` | Start lowering brightness |
| `hue_dimmer.stop` | Freeze brightness |

| Field | Actions | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `target` | all | Hue lights and groups (required) |
| `sweep_time` | raise, lower | Duration of a full 0–100% sweep (default 5s) |
| `limit` | raise | Max brightness (default 100%) |
| `limit` | lower | Min brightness (default 0%). Light turns off at 0%. Choose 0.4%+ to keep light on |

To dim multiple lights perfectly, target a **Hue Group** instead of separate lights. Your Hue Bridge will then sync them with group-wide Zigbee messages.

#### YAML Example: Two-button dimmer

```yaml
left_button_held:
  - action: hue_dimmer.lower

right_button_held:
  - action: hue_dimmer.raise

buttons_released:
  - action: hue_dimmer.stop
```

---

### Set Brightness, Color & Color Temperature While Light Is Off

* Eliminate color flashes and brightness extremes when lights turn on
* Create consistent turn-on behavior across your home and automations

| Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hue_dimmer.set_attributes` | Set brightness, color temp or color without changing on/off state |
| `hue_dimmer.get_attributes` | Get brightness, color temp and color (RGB, HS, XY), even if lights are off. Returns one record per target |

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `target` | Hue lights and groups (required) |
| `brightness` | Brightness level (%) |
| `min_brightness` | Enforce a minimum brightness (%) |
| `max_brightness` | Enforce a maximum brightness (%) |
| `color_temp_kelvin` | Color temperature (K) |
| `rgb_color` | Color as `[red, green, blue]` (0–255 each) |
| `hs_color` | Color as `[hue, saturation]` (0–360, 0–100) |
| `xy_color` | Color as `[x, y]` |

> **Breaking change:** the `get_attributes` response field `color_xy` is renamed to `xy_color`, for naming consistency with Home Assistant. Replace `color_xy` with `xy_color` in your automations.


#### GUI Automation Example: When lights turn off for an hour, set brightness for next turn-on

![Set turn-on behavior](examples/update-lights-after-turn-off--step-2.png)

To set up this automation:

1. Go to **Settings > Automations**
2. Click **Create automation** and **Create new automation**
3. Open the ⋮ menu and switch view to **Edit in YAML**
4. Copy-paste the YAML below (replacing HA's placeholder YAML)
5. Switch view back to **Edit in visual editor**
6. Select the ["When something changes" entry](examples/update-lights-after-turn-off--step-1.png?raw=true) and add your Hue light(s).
7. Select the "Set turn-on behavior" entry and choose your settings. Don't touch the Targets section.
8. Click **Save**

```yaml
description: >
  When lights turn off for an hour, set brightness for next turn-on.
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: []
    from:
      - "on"
    to:
      - "off"
    for:
      hours: 1
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 0
actions:
  - action: hue_dimmer.set_attributes
    target:
      entity_id: "{{ trigger.entity_id }}"
    data:
      max_brightness: 80
      min_brightness: 30
      alias: Set turn-on behavior for the lights
mode: parallel
max: 10
```

If you add more than 10 lights, increase "max: 10" accordingly.

#### Set a Scene Without Turning Lights On

| Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hue_dimmer.set_scene` | Set a Hue scene's brightness, color and color temp on its lights without turning them on |

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `target` | Hue scenes (required) |

Lights come on in the scene the next time they're turned on. Good to know:

* Lights that are already on change to the scene straight away.
* Lights the scene turns off are turned off.
* Static scenes only. All-Day (smart) scenes aren't supported yet.
* Dynamic scenes are set to their first colors and don't animate.

```yaml
description: Stage the Relax scene in the living room at 22:00.
triggers:
  - trigger: time
    at: "22:00:00"
actions:
  - action: hue_dimmer.set_scene
    target:
      entity_id: scene.living_room_relax
```

## Known Limitations

**Brightness reports the end value during a transition.** When a raise or lower starts, the Hue bridge reports the target brightness straight away (for example 100%), then checks the light's real brightness about 10 seconds later. During that window, dashboards, switch indicators and automations that read brightness see the end value, not the light's actual level.

Dimming itself is unaffected: the integration tracks the real brightness internally, so stopping and restarting a dim carries on from where the light actually is. If an automation needs the real level mid-transition, read it with `hue_dimmer.get_attributes`, which returns the integration's predicted brightness rather than the bridge's end value.
